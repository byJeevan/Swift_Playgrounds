### Enums (Tj.Veens - Swift in Depth)
- Enums are sometimes an alternative to subclassing, allowing for a flexible architecture.
- Enums give you the ability to catch problems at compile time instead of runtime.
- You can use enums to group properties together.
- Enums are sometimes called sum types, based on algebraic data types.
- Structs can be distributed over enums.
- When working with enum’s raw values, you forego catching problems at compile time.
- Handling strings can be made safer by converting them to enums.
- When converting a string to an enum, grouping cases and using a lowercased string makes conversion easier.”
